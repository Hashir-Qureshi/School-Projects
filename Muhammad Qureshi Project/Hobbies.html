<p style="font-size:18px; width:90%;">My favorite hobby is watching Korean Dramas. What can I say, I am a hopeless romantic! K-dramas (short for Korean Dramas) just offer a softer touch to romance when compared to American shows. I used to watch American shows, but after a while they moved more towards the lustful side of romance. Watching K-dramas just makes me feel warm and not to mention the music in the dramas is amazing as well. Every song is created exclusively for the show and matches the tone of the scenes it is played in.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; width:90%;">A close second is video games. I grew up with video games and I have been playing them ever since. I love the online aspect of video games and how you can create a community around a game you love. It makes you feel like you have an extended family. Everyone is extremely close, because we all share an incredible bond over video games.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; width:90%;">Another one of my hobbies is listening to original soundtracks of my K-dramas. Yes, I know I already talked about my obsession with K-dramas, but this is mildly related. Everyone asks me why I listen to songs I don’t understand the words to. But what they don’t get is that the meaning of a song is behind the feeling of the rhythm, and harmony of vocals and instruments. I don’t treat music as just sound. I am a very detailed listener and love to be swept away in my music. I like to feel the emotions the artist is trying to convey.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; width:90%;">My last hobby, if you can call it that, is trying out new and innovative technology. I love to test out things I find cool and interesting. The tech ranges from smartwatches to tablet/laptop hybrids. I even test out headphones because I am always trying to find a better listening experience. All this tech can be pretty expensive though, so I tend to do it once in a while.</p>
