Yellow is the color between green and orange in the spectrum of visible light, the color of ripe lemons, sunflowers and gold.
It is a primary color in subtractive color, used in color printing. According to surveys in Europe, Canada and the United States, 
yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, and spontaneity, but also with duplicity, envy, 
jealousy, avarice, and, in the U.S., with cowardice. It plays an important role in Asian culture, particularly in China, where it 
is seen as the color of happiness, glory, wisdom, harmony and culture.
