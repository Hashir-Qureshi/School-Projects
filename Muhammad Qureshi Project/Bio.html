<p style="font-size:18px; width:90%;">My name is Muhammad Qureshi and I was born in Pakistan. My family, which consisted of my mother, my two sisters, my brother and I, immigrated to America in 2004. We had to leave my dad behind due to legal reasons. I am the youngest of the four siblings. My sisters are married with kids. When we moved here, my siblings had a hard time adjusting to the culture. However, I grasped it quickly and it never became a problem for me.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; width:90%;">I have had to live with stuttering for as long as I can remember and It has made it difficult for me to socialize. It became so severe, that I ended up dropping out of high school. After I dropped out of high school, I started to look at my life differently. Everyone around me was moving ahead in their lives and I was stuck in the same place. I watched as my mom slaved herself at her job to provide for us, and how my brother worked tirelessly to support our father back in Pakistan. I am really close to my nieces and nephews and I didn’t want them to have someone like me as a role model. I decided to make a change and attempt to turn my life around by earning a GED.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; width:90%;">After earning my GED, I had to start considering the direction to take my life in. My brother and I have been playing games ever since we were old enough to hold controllers, so naturally I was leaning towards a career involving games. It wasn’t until I went to college that my love for programming surfaced. I love technology and experiencing programming made my love for technology grow even more. I plan to start off by developing applications for the desktop or android. After gaining valuable experience as a programmer, I would ultimately like to program games. I want to be stable enough in my life to support my mom and provide financial safety for my nieces and nephews. </p>
